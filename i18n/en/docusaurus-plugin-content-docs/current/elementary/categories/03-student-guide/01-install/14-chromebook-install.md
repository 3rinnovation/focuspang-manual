# Chromebook Installation

- Install the **Chrome Extension**. See the video guide ([ðŸ”—Link](https://focuspang.com/_dn_.html#Google)).

- Access and use the site ([ðŸ”—Link](https://student.focuspang.com)) in a **Chrome browser**.

- Your teacher will **use CEU** to **force install the Chrome extension to all students** and **pin it so students can't delete it**.
