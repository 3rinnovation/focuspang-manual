# Install focuspang on Windows

## What we're going to do

We're going to install focuspang on your Windows computer so you can use it in class with your teacher.
The app will help you see what your teacher is showing and answer questions during lessons.

Don't worry if this seems complicated - we'll go through each step together, and you can ask for help if you need it.

## Before we start

Make sure you have:

- Your Windows computer (laptop or desktop)
- Internet connection
- About 10 minutes of time

## Step 1: Download the installation file

<div class="fp-download-container fp-download-green">
  <div>
    <div class="fp-download-title">Windows Installation File</div>
    <div class="fp-download-desc">FocuspangStudentSetup.exe</div>
  </div>
  <a
    class="fp-download-button"
    href="https://ss1.cloud.kt.com:1000/focuspang-media/downloads/FocuspangStudentSetup.exe"
  >
    <img
      class="fp-download-icon"
      src="/img/download-white-icon.svg"
      alt="download"
    />
    Download
  </a>
</div>

Click the **Download** button above to get the focuspang installation file.

## Step 2: Install the app

- Double-click the downloaded file to start installation
- When you see messages asking for permission, click "Install" or "Continue"

## Step 3: Set up Chrome browser (if needed)

focuspang works best with **Chrome browser**.
If you don't have Chrome installed yet, visit [Chrome installation guide](https://www.google.com/intl/ko_kr/chrome) to install it.

## Step 4: Install Chrome extension (if needed)

For the best experience on Windows, you might need to install the Chrome extension.
See the video guide ([ðŸ”—Link](https://focuspang.com/_dn_.html#Google)) for help.

## You're all done!

Great job! You've successfully installed focuspang on your Windows computer.
If you have any trouble installing or if the screen looks different from these instructions, ask your teacher for help.
