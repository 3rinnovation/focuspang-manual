# Install focuspang on Android Devices

## What we're going to do

We're going to install focuspang on your Android tablet so you can use it in class with your teacher.
The app will help you see what your teacher is showing and answer questions during lessons.

Don't worry if this seems complicated - we'll go through each step together, and you can ask for help if you need it.

## Before we start

Make sure you have:

- Your Android tablet (like a Samsung tablet)
- Internet connection
- About 10 minutes of time

## Step 1: Download the app

<div class="fp-download-container fp-download-green">
  <div>
    <div class="fp-download-title">Android App</div>
    <div class="fp-download-desc">Google Play Store</div>
  </div>
  <a
    class="fp-download-button"
    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.focuspang.student"
  >
    <img
      class="fp-download-icon"
      src="/img/download-white-icon.svg"
      alt="download"
    />
    Download
  </a>
</div>

First, we need to download the focuspang app file to your tablet.

## Step 2: Install the app

When you try to install the app, your tablet might show a message about "unknown sources" or "apps from outside the Play Store."

This is normal - your tablet is just being careful. It's safe to continue installing focuspang.

## Step 3: Let the app work properly

After installing, your tablet will ask you to allow focuspang to do certain things. You need to say "Allow" to these requests so the app can work with your teacher:

### Allow the app to see what you're doing

This helps your teacher know if you're paying attention in class.
Look for "Usage Access" and tap **Allow**.

### Allow the app to help you focus

This helps the app work better during class time.
Look for "Accessibility" and tap **Allow**.

### Allow the app to show messages

This lets your teacher send you messages during class.
Look for "Display over other apps" and tap **Allow**.

## Step 4: Set up your web browser

Make sure Chrome is your main web browser so focuspang works best.
