# Install focuspang on Android Devices

## Install

### Step 1: Download the app

<div class="fp-download-container fp-download-green">
  <div>
    <div class="fp-download-title">Android App</div>
    <div class="fp-download-desc">Google Play Store</div>
  </div>
  <a
    class="fp-download-button"
    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.focuspang.student"
  >
    <img
      class="fp-download-icon"
      src="/img/download-white-icon.svg"
      alt="download"
    />
    Download
  </a>
</div>

First, we need to download the focuspang app file to your tablet.

You can watch this video to see how it's done: [ðŸ”—Installation guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBcpvCpa3nk)

## Step 2: Install the app

When you try to install the app, your tablet might show a message about "unknown sources" or "apps from outside the Play Store."

This is normal - your tablet is just being careful. It's safe to continue installing focuspang.

## Step 3: Let the app work properly

After installing, your tablet will ask you to allow focuspang to do certain things. You need to say "Allow" to these requests so the app can work with your teacher:
