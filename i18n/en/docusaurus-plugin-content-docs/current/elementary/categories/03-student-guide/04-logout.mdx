# 4. Logout

When you're finished using focuspang, it's important to logout to keep your account safe. Let's learn how to logout properly.

## Why should you logout?

Logging out is important because:

- It keeps your account safe from others
- It prevents other people from using your account
- It's a good habit when using shared devices at school
- It protects your personal information

Think of it like closing your locker at school - you want to make sure only you can access your things!

## When should you log out?

You should log out when:

- You're finished using focuspang for the day
- You want to switch to a different student account
- You're using a shared computer or tablet
- Before leaving the computer

## How to log out

### Step 1: Go to settings

From the home screen, click your profile picture or name in the upper left corner to go to the Settings page.

### Step 2: Log out safely

Once you're in the Settings page, you can log out from there.

:::tip Remember to log out
Always log out when you're done, especially if you're using a shared device. This keeps your account safe and lets other students use the device.

- Your account information stays safe

- All your class information and work is still saved for next time
