# 4. Logout

## When should you log out?

You should log out when:

- You're finished using focuspang for the day
- You want to switch to a different student account
- You're using a shared computer or tablet

## How to log out

### Step 1: Go to settings

From the home screen, click your profile picture or name in the upper left corner to go to the Settings page.

### Step 2: Log out

Once you're in the Settings page, you can log out from there.

:::tip Remember to log out
Always log out when you're done, especially if you're using a shared device. This keeps your account safe and lets other students use the device.
