# 2. Creating a Class

### Create - Classroom Teacher

Before you can create a class, you must first create the **half** of the class\
To create a class, first select a grade and a class. If **Class** is not a number, select the **Enter your own** checkbox to enter the class name in Korean.

### Create - Subject Teacher

For **Specialized Subject Teachers**, click the **Start as a Subject Teacher** button instead of [Create Class] to create a class.

:::danger caution

When a subject specialist creates a class, all classes are bound together with a single invitation code and cannot be separated.

Therefore, you must **create your classes individually** without creating a class.

Then you can create each one by pressing the **[+Add Lesson]** button.

### Invite

When you create a class, an **invitation code** for that class is automatically generated. This invitation code is required for students to join the class.

- Students will need to enter the invitation **code, class number, and name** to join the class.
- No matter what classes you add to your schedule, the invitation code for the same class will be the same.
