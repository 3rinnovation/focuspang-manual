# 2. Creating a Class

### Creation

Before creating lessons, you must first create a 'class' for the grade.\
If the 'class' is in Korean rather than numbers, check the direct input checkbox and enter the class name in Korean.

You can check on the left whether the created class has been properly registered.

ðŸš¨ **Warning**

Special subject teachers who are not homeroom teachers should not create a 'class'. Instead, click the [Start as Subject Teacher] button in the create class window. Then click the [+Add Lesson] button to create individual lessons.

If special subject teachers create a 'class', all lessons will be bundled under one invitation code, making it impossible to operate lessons separately.
Therefore, please make sure to create lessons individually without creating a class.

### Inviting

When you create a class, an invitation code for that class is automatically generated. This invitation code is essential for students to participate in lessons.

- Students must enter invitation code + student number + name to join the teacher's lesson.\
- Even if the teacher adds any lesson within the timetable, the invitation code for the same class remains the same.
