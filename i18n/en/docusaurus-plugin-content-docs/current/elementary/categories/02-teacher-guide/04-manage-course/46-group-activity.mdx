### Step 2: Set Up Groups

1. Enter the group activity **topic** (e.g., “Environmental Protection Project,” “Science Experiment”)
2. Specify the **number of students** per group (typically 4–6 is ideal)
3. Click **[Random Assignment]** to automatically form groups

:::tip Tips for Grouping

- If you want to change only a few students, you can adjust them using the Change Group option
- If you prefer to assign groups manually, use Random Assignment first, then modify each student’s group as needed
