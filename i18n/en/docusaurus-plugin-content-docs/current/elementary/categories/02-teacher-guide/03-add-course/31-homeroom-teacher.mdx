# Homeroom Teacher

## Creating a Class

### Step 1: Select grade and class

2. Next, choose the **class.** If the class is not a number (e.g., “Love Class,” “Hope Class”), check **Enter your own** and type the class name.

### Step 3: Invite students

Once the class is created, an invite code is automatically generated. Students must enter this code to join the class.

:::tip What is an invite code?

- The invite code works like a **password** for students to enter your class.
- Students need to enter the **invite code + student ID + name** to join.
- For homeroom teachers, **the same invite code is always used for that class**, no matter which lesson you add.
