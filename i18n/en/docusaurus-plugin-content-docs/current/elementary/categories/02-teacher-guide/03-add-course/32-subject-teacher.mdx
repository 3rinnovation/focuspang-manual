# For subject teachers

## Creating a Class

Subject teachers (PE, music, art, etc.) should create individual lessons instead of a class.

:::warning Why shouldn't subject teachers create a class?
If subject teachers create a class, all lessons get the same invitation code. This means you can't manage 1st grade and 2nd grade lessons separately.
That's why you need to create individual lessons instead.
:::

### Step 1: Start as a subject teacher

Click the **[Start as a Subject Teacher]** button instead of [Create Class].

### Step 3: Fill in lesson details

2. In the pop-up window, enter the following information:
   - **Course name**: The subject you're teaching
   - **Grade**: Which grade level
   - **Class**: Which class number
   - **Day**: What day of the week
   - **Period**: What time period

### Step 4: Create the lesson

3. Click the **[Add Lesson]** button to create your lesson

:::info Adding multiple lessons
If you want to add the same lesson for other days of the week, you can add multiple lesson periods at once by clicking the **[+ Add Class Period]** button.

### Step 5: Invite students to your class

After creating your class or lessons, an **invitation code** is automatically created.
Give this invitation code to your students so they can join your lessons.

:::tip What is an invitation code?

- An invitation code is like a **password** that students need to enter your lessons
- Students enter the **invitation code + student ID + name** to join
