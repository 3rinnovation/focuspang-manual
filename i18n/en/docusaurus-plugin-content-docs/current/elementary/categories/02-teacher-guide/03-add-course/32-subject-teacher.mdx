# Subject Teacher

## Creating Lessons

Subject teachers (e.g., PE, Music, Art) should create lessons directly instead of creating a class.

:::warning Why not create a class as a subject teacher?

If a subject teacher creates a class, all lessons will be tied to a single invite code, making it impossible to manage Grade 1 and Grade 2 separately. That’s why you need to create lessons one by one.

:::

### Step 1: Start as a subject teacher

1. Click the **[Start as a Subject Teacher]** button instead of [Create Class].

### Step 3: Enter lesson details

In the pop-up, enter:

- **Subject**: e.g., Korean, Math, English

- **Grade**: the grade level

- **Class**: the class number

- **Day**: the day of the week

- **Period**: the lesson period

### Step 4: Complete lesson creation

Click the **[Add Lesson]** button to finish.

:::info What if the same lesson is on multiple days?

Click **[+ Add Lesson Time]** to add multiple lessons at once.

:::

### Step 5: Invite students

Once the lesson is created, an **invite code** is automatically generated. Students must enter this code to join the lesson.

:::tip What is an invite code?

- It works like a **password** that students need to enter your lesson.
- Students join with **invite code + student ID + name.**
