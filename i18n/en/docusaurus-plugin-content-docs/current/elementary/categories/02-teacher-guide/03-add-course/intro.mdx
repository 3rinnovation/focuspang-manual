# 3. Create a Class / Lesson

To start using focuspang, youâ€™ll first need to create your **class or lesson.** The steps are slightly different depending on whether you are a homeroom teacher or a subject teacher, so please choose the option that matches your role.

- **Create a class**: Students will use an invite code to join your class.

- **Create a lesson**: Once your lesson is ready, you and your students can enjoy activities like Focus Time and Quizpang together.
