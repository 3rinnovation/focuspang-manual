# 3. Creating a Class / Lesson

## Why do you need to create a class?

Before you can use focuspang, you'll need to create your **class and lesson** first. The process is slightly different for homeroom teachers and subject teachers.

- You need to create a class so that students can join the lesson using an invitation code.
- Once you create a class, you can do activities like focus time and quiz games together with students.
