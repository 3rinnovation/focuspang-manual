# 3. Create a Class / Lesson

To start using focuspang, youâ€™ll first need to create your **class or lesson.**
Classes need to be created so that students will use an **invite code to join your class**,
and once lessons are created, you and your students can enjoy activities like Focus Time and Quizpang together.

The steps are slightly different depending on whether you are a homeroom teacher or a subject teacher, so please choose the option that matches your role.
