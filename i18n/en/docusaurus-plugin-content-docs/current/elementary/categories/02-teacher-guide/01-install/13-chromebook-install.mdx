# Using focuspang on Chromebook

:::info Note
You don’t need to install an app on Chromebook. You can use focuspang directly from the web browser.
The focuspang Teacher app for iOS is not released yet. For now, please use it in the browser, just like on a Chromebook.

### Step 1: Open Chrome browser

On your Chromebook, open the **Chrome browser** (it’s already installed by default).

### Step 2: Go to the focuspang Teacher site

In the address bar, type **teacher.focuspang.com** to access the site.

1. Open the focuspang site.

2. Click the **three-dot menu button** in the top right corner of Chrome.

3. **Select Send, Save & Share → Create Shortcut.**

4. A focuspang icon will appear on your desktop.

## Cautions
