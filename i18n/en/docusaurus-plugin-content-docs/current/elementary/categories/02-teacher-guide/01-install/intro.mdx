# 1. Installation

## What is focuspang for teachers?

Install focuspang on the device youâ€™ll be using as a teacher.

The teacher version of focuspang works on **various devices.**

From the left sidebar or the list below, select the device youâ€™ll use:

- [Windows (MS Windows)](/en/docs/elementary/teacher-guide/install-windows)
- [Android](/en/docs/elementary/teacher-guide/install-android)
- [Chromebook / iOS device](/en/docs/elementary/teacher-guide/install-chromebook)

:::info Notes

- On Windows, Chromebook, and iOS devices, you can use focuspang directly by accessing the [**ðŸ”—homepage**](https://teacher.focuspang.com) in the Chrome browser without installing an app.
- On Android, please install the app because using focuspang smoothly in a mobile browser may be difficult.
- The iPad version of the teacher app will be released soon.
