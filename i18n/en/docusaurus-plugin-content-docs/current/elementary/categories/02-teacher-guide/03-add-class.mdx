# 3. Creating a Class

## Why do you need to create a class?

Before you can use focuspang, you'll need to create your **class** first.
This generates an invitation code that students use to join your lessons.

The process is slightly different for homeroom teachers and subject teachers.

## For homeroom teachers

### Step 1: Choose your grade and class

1. First, select your **grade**
2. Next, select your **class number**
3. If your class name is not a number (like "Love Class" or "Hope Class"), check the **Enter your own** box and type the class name

### Step 2: Confirm your class

After creating your class, check the **top-left menu** to make sure it appears there.

## For subject teachers

Subject teachers (PE, music, art, etc.) should create individual lessons instead of a class.

:::tip Why shouldn't subject teachers create a class?
If subject teachers create a class, all lessons get the same invitation code. This means you can't manage 1st grade and 2nd grade lessons separately.
That's why you need to create individual lessons instead.
:::

### Step 1: Start as a subject teacher

Click the **[Start as a Subject Teacher]** button instead of [Create Class].

2. Create separate lessons for each grade and class you teach

## How to invite students to your class

After creating your class or lessons, an **invitation code** is automatically created.
Give this invitation code to your students so they can join your lessons.

### What is an invitation code?

- An invitation code is like a **password** that students need to enter your lessons
- Students enter the **invitation code + student ID + name** to join
- For homeroom teachers, all lessons for the same class use the **same invitation code**
