# 1. Admin Role

## What is a focuspang administrator?

A focuspang administrator is someone who manages teacher accounts at your school.
Usually, the IT coordinator or computer teacher becomes the administrator.
Administrators help make sure all teachers can use focuspang properly in their classrooms.

## What can administrators do?

- **Manage teacher accounts**: Approve new teacher registrations and edit account information
- **Add other administrators**: Give administrator privileges to other teachers if needed
- **Suspend or delete accounts**: Remove accounts when necessary for school management

:::tip Administrator vs Teacher
Administrators only handle **account management**. The actual teaching activities (like focus time and quizzes) are done by individual teachers in their classrooms.
