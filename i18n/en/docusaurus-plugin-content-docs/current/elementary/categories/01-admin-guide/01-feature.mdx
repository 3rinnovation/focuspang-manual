# 1. Admin Role

## Who is a focuspang administrator?

A focuspang administrator is the person who manages teacher accounts at your school.
This is usually the IT coordinator or computer science teacher.
They help to ensure every teacher can use Focuspang smoothly in their classrooms.

## What can administrators do?

- **Manage teacher accounts**: Approve new teacher registrations and edit account information
- **Add other administrators**: Give administrator privileges to other teachers if needed
- **Suspend or delete accounts**: Remove accounts when necessary for school management

:::tip Administrator vs Teacher
Administrators only handle **account management**. The actual teaching activities (like focus time and quizzes) are done by individual teachers in their classrooms.
