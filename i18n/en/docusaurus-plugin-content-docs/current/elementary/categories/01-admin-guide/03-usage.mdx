# 3. Account Management

## What is account management?

Account management is where you control all the teacher and student accounts at your school.
You can approve new teachers, manage existing accounts, and help when teachers have problems with their accounts.

## How to manage accounts

### Adding new administrators

You can add other teachers as administrators by clicking the **[Add Admin]** button.
The new administrator will have the same permissions as you do.

### Managing teacher accounts

You can manage teacher accounts in several ways:

- **Suspend**: Temporarily disable an account (for example, when a teacher is on leave)
- **Delete**: Remove an account completely (for example, when a teacher retires or transfers)
- **Edit information**: Change a teacher's name or other details
- **Reset password**: Help teachers who forgot their passwords

### Managing student accounts

You can **edit student information** like names and student ID numbers when needed.

### Approving new teacher accounts

This is one of your most important tasks as an administrator.

#### Step 1: Teachers register first

After a teacher completes registration, they cannot use their account until you approve it.

#### Step 2: Check pending approvals

You can see **accounts waiting for approval** by clicking the **[Status]** icon on the admin page.

#### Step 3: Approve the accounts

Review the teacher's information and approve their account so they can start using focuspang.

:::tip Why do accounts need approval?
This approval process helps keep your school's focuspang system secure by making sure only authorized teachers can access student information.
