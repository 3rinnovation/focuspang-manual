# 1. Admin Role

## What is a focuspang administrator?

A focuspang administrator manages teacher accounts at your school.
Usually, the IT coordinator or computer teacher becomes the administrator.
Administrators ensure that all teachers can use focuspang effectively in their classrooms.

## What can administrators do?

- **Manage teacher accounts**: Approve new teacher registrations and edit account information
- **Add other administrators**: Grant administrator privileges to other teachers when needed
- **Suspend or delete accounts**: Remove accounts when necessary for school management

:::tip Administrator vs Teacher
Administrators handle **account management** only. The actual teaching activities (like focus time and quizzes) are done by individual teachers in their classrooms.
